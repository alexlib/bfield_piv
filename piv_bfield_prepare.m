% run ImageJ to:
%   1) computes average intensity of base & cross images (laser pulse has

%   image stack, this brings the background levels to ~ zero
%   2) enhance contrast which reduces correlation peak-to-peak differences (this
%   operation does not require to be split between base & cross image stacks)
%   3) convert all to 8-bit images
    
% THIS REQUIRES IMAGEJ TO BE INSTALLED and callable from the command line
%     FUDGE -- Windows seems to require 8-bit at all times, while *nix
%     can accept 16-bit images -- I guess should convert to 8-bit first
%     to enforce cross-compatibility ... just use ImageJ to convert the
%     entire stack to 8-bit:
%     ... actually I cannot install on Windows for other Java related
